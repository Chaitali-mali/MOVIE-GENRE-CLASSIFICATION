# MOVIE-GENRE-CLASSIFICATION
🎬 Movie Genre Classification using Machine Learning 🤖📚

I’m excited to share my latest machine learning project — Movie Genre Classification! 🚀
In this project, I built a model that predicts the genre of a movie based solely on its plot summary using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

🔍 Key Highlights:
✅ Preprocessing of movie plot data
✅ Feature extraction using TF-IDF and word embeddings
✅ Classification using Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM
✅ Achieved impressive accuracy and insights on genre patterns
✅ Interactive visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn

🧠 Technologies Used:

Python

Scikit-learn

NLTK / SpaCy

Pandas & NumPy

Jupyter Notebook

📊 This project showcases the power of text data in solving real-world classification problems and enhances my skills in NLP, classification models, and feature engineering.
